Automatic Forecasting Techniques

Automatic Forecasting differs from traditional modeling in that the goal is to minimize forecast error by selecting from a predefined list the model with the lowest MAPE or other statistic.  Each model is fit and then multistep forecasts are generated over a holdout period of know data.  These forecasts are then compared to the known data.

Commonly Used Statistics

Mean Average Percent Error (MAPE)  $\frac{1}{N}$
Mean Average Error (MAE)
Symmetric Mean Average Percent Error (SMAPE)
